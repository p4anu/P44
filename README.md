# P44
This is a logical databasse (in arrays) and key control
INFORMATION ABOUT P44
P44 is a small algorithm with some data loaded into it (in the manner of arrays). It requests an access code, and a record number, from the user. The access code, by action of a first conditional if, must match the keyword stored in a variable (the key is "blanco"). Then, upon entering the key, the user enters his or her record number and the algorithm returns to the array where that entered number is, or is not, a data (string "") stored. 
The array (object) is one dimensional.
This small project also contains the corresponding .jar file.
